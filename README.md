# How to use this organization and contribute

## What it is

This Organization holds repositories of lessons and daily class work, labs, homework, and installation lessons.

## Contributing

Before creating a new repository search through organization to make sure your content is unique.

*If it is not unique*

Clone the repository that contains an iteration of your content and make a new branch to push your content to.

_see naming conventions below_

*If it is unique*

Create a new repository with a master and a solution branch.

_see naming conventions below_

## Naming Conventions

#### Repositories

Name of the repo should start with language abbreviation followed by the type of content and the name of the assignment.

_examples:_
```
js-hw-function-reps
ruby-lab-banana-stand
```

Once the repo is created add a description to the repository describing the content or listing the tech tags:

_examples_
```
[express, pg, crud, sql, ejs]
[rails backend, angular/express front-end]
[js, command line app]
[html, css, js]
```

## Branches

Every repo should have the starter code, lesson, README, instructions, examples, on the `master` branch.

The solution code in a solutions branch.

#### Iterating on existing content

If changes are updates be sure to update the master branch as well as the solution branch.

#### Adding a new version of existing content

Your branch name should include your name and whether it's the master or the solution.

```
<your name>-master
<your name>-solution
```

## Making Changes

Create an issue on the repo in question and list the problem, proposed fix, or addition and the associated branch, file, line number, etc.

The content owner can either make that change or suggest that it goes into a new version of the lesson made by _you!_
